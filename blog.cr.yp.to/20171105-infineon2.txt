Dear Petr,
First of all, congrats to you and your co-authors on finding this vulnerability
and attacking it. Awesome! How did you think about checking the moduli modulo
small primes? Did you know they were using the power generator?

Of course Dan and I are curious whether we reconstructed the same attack
from seeing your test and Graham's tweet made me realize that I don't
know exactly how you solve it (we didn't reverse engineer the timings to
figure out the implementation ;-) ).

Please find attached the file with our short description of which we
tweeted the sha256sum last night. If I were to guess what their source
code does it will have L as the product of all small primes and compute
g^random mod L and then add a random multiple of L. We used CRT and l_i
in our writeup but don't necessarily expect that to be part of the code.

We're wondering about a few more inmplementation details but for now
we would be curious to hear your feedback on whether we got things
right.

All the best
       	Dan and Tanja
