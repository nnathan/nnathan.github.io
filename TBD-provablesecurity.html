TBD: An incomplete introduction to provable security
</h2>
<p>
This post is primarily aimed
to help uninitiated students
taking a cryptography course
and wondering what
this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security>provable security</a>
fuss is all about.
You probably chose
a course
titled
"Cryptography" or
"Modern Cryptography" or
"Applied Cryptography",
and thought it
had to do with
learning about actual cryptographic algorithms
and
implementing cryptography.
Sorry to say,
if you are here
trying to figure out
what the hell is going on
and
start to think
cryptography is all about
proofs
then you were probably bamboozled.
<!-- on the marketing of cryptography courses -->
Fear not,
this post
is to help
fill in the gaps
on the <i>why</i>
of provable security
and
what value it provides.
</p>
<p>
Provable security is a subfield of security
which almost always
combines cryptography
in some way.
Cryptography lives in the intersection
of mathematics and computer science.
This distinction is important
and you will find cryptography
courses in math and computer science departments
is wildly different
and use a completely different language.
</p>
<p>
<i>Security reductions</i>
lie at the heart of
provable security.
A security reduction
is a "proof"
stating an algorithm
somehow related to cryptography
provides a specific security guarantee.
I like this excerpt from Joy of Cryptography
which
distills the essence
of security reductions:
<blockquote>
“<i>any</i> encryption scheme,
when combined with this other thing
in this specific way,
results in a system
with security property X,
as long as the encryption scheme
satisfies property Y”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The syntax of
a security reduction
is in the form of a logical implication:
<blockquote>
[Thing-Π is Y secure] &rArr; [Thing-Π is X secure]
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Thing-Π
is actually a <i>placeholder</i>
which can substituted
with a real
concrete implementation.
</p>
<p>
Let's look
at a concrete example:
<ul>
<li>
define Thing-Π
as <i>any</i>
encryption scheme
using randomised encryption
with
authentication
</li>
<li>replace (<i>instance</i>) Thing-Π with AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256</li>
<li>replace Y with IND-CCA2</li>
<li>replace X with IND-CPA</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
&rArr;
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CPA secure].
This
is an actual
security claim
that <i>we believe</i>
is true. But the details like
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
and
IND-{CPA,CCA2}
is irrelevant.
From experience,
I never heard the words
AES or SHA256 uttered
in any provable security
course
that I took.
</p>
<p>
Note,
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is an <i>instance</i>
of Thing-Π.
We could have
used
something else
like
ChaCha20-Poly1305.
</p>
<p>
One could think
of
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
as an <i>advertisement</i>. <!-- add footnote: it is actually a security claim or security guarantee -->
The "product"
is the encryption scheme
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
which has all the
security features
of IND-CCA2 security.
Caveat emptor,
provable security
isn't a silver bullet
for security,
as with all matters in life,
it helps to maintain
a healthy level of
<a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>skepticism.</a>
Provable security
claims are helpful
to cryptography practitioners
and
required by <a href=https://www.nist.gov/topics/cryptography>standard committees</a>
which vet and
publish security schemes.
</p>

<p>
Ostensibly,
a security reduction
communicates
a set of related ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the security of Thing-Π which is Y-secure is X-secure</li>
<li> the security of Thing-Π with Y-security <i>reduces</i> to X-security</li>
<li> Thing-Π with Y-security is <i>at least as secure</i> as X-security</li>
<li> an attack on X is an attack on Y (note to self: while this is usually the case - I don't think you can derive a generic claim in all instances)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example,
if someone says their encryption scheme
is IND-CCA2 secure
then you can say
it resists all attacks
to IND-CPA, a weaker security notion.
</p>
<p>
As a student
you will need to prove
security reductions,
which makes up
most of your coursework.
In what follows
I will show how
to attack a securiy reduction.
</p>
<h3>Showing a security reduction</h3>
<p>
In case you aren't aware or didn't realise,
we prove most security reductions
using <i>proof by contradiction</i>.
</p>

<p>
When you encounter
[Thing-Π is X-secure]
&rArr;
[Thing-Π is Y-secure]
drop Thing-Π so we have
[X-security] &hArr; [Y-security].
Don't worry,
we will bring back Thing-Π
in a cool minute.
</p>
<p>
To simplify further
we reword to say
[<b>no</b> attack against X] &hArr; [<b>no</b> attack against Y].
An attack is some violation of X or Y.

Now apply the transforms:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Contrapositive rule
(P &rArr; Q)
&hArr;
(&not;P &rArr; &not;Q):</br>
[<b>an</b> attack against Y]
&rArr;
[<b>an</b> attack against X]</li>
<li>Material implication
(P &rArr; Q)
&hArr;
(P &or; &not;Q):</br>
[<b>an</b> attack against Y]
<b>or</b>
[<b>no</b> attack against X]</li>
<li>Negate statement using De-Morgan's law
&not;(P &or; Q)
&hArr;
(&not;P &and; &not;Q):<br/>
[<b>no</b> attack against Y]
&and;
[<b>an</b> attack against X]</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here's a handy tip in life:
when you prove implication
<b>P</b>&rArr;<b>Q</b>
using contradiction
you should have on instant recall:
<b>P</b> &and; &not;<b>Q</b>.
That is,
assume
<b>P</b> to be true,
using &not;<b>Q</b>
show <b>P</b> is false,
(the contradiction)
which states
<b>P</b>&and;&not;<b>Q</b> is false,
and everything else
is true.
The setup
for contradiction is easy.
The hard part
is showing the contradiction.
</p>
<p>
Back to the proof.
We have
[<b>no</b> attack against Y]</li>
&and;
[<b>an</b> attack against X]</li>.
Let's put Thing-Π back.
Now we have
[<b>no</b> attack against Y for Thing-Π]</li>
&and;
[<b>an</b> attack against X for Thing-Π]</li>.
<b>Now this
is the detail
you need to fill in</b>:
you need to show
an attack on X for Thing-Π
can convert into
an attack on Y.
Then we contradict
the assumption
[<b>no</b> attack against Y for Thing-Π].
Which means the entire statement is false.
And this means
the negation (3)
is true.
This truth propagates backwards
to the original statement
[Thing-Π is X-secure]
&rArr;
[Thing-Π is Y-secure],
which we conclude is true.
</p>
<p>
Note that attacking
the proof
directly
can be futile.
That is you first
show the pair
[Thing-Π is X-secure]
and
[Thing-Π is <b>not</b> Y-secure]
is false,
and
show all remaining cases
true.
</p>
<h3>"Why do I care?"</h3>
<p>
This probably sounds
wonderful or pointless theory.
At the
end of the day
you want to know
"is the thing secure?"
The provable security
framework
<i>helps</i> to answer
the question
by defining security
and
then prove it.
Some consider it
a gold standard.
Students who put
in the effort
will probably come out
feeling
(potentially a false sense of)
enlightened
and come to the same conclusion.
There is a divide among cryptographers
on the value of provable security.
It all started
with a <a href=http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/~ajmeneze/anotherlook/ams.shtml>critique</a>
created a major
upset
among the foremost experts
<a href=https://www.ams.org/notices/200711/tx071101454p.pdf>demanding a retraction</a>
to what they consider
a threat to their existence.
Computer scientists sided
with provable security
and
mathematicians went
their own way.
Then there are the practitioners
who develop and provide cryptography
solutions in the hand of users.
I like to call these people
applied cryptographers.
One applied cryptographer
I know of
<a href=https://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html>
doesn't bother</a>
advertising using provable security jargon.
Another wrote
<a href=https://www.schneier.com/books/applied_cryptography/>an encyclopedia</a>
which was used
throughout the 90s
but is outdated
and
no longer in fashion.
In my own observations
I have noticed
<!-- insert nacl link -->
in recent years
some cryptography libraries
now give a nod to
provable security,
e.g.  <a href=https://nacl.cr.yp.to/</a>nacl,</a>
My advice for now,
is to know opinions differ
on the value of provable security,
but the best way to understand
the arguments made,
is to first understand the machinery
of provable security.
So don't think
that people critiquing
provable security
is not a reason
to not do your homework.
And with all matters in life,
it is helpful to maintain
<a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>healthy skepticism</a>.
<!-- footnote to say the definitions for security and privacy is hard and adversaries are moving targets -->
</p>
<p>
Insofar
I have given a
superficial view
to provable security.
I omitted a lot of detail.
I didn't even touch
on <i>assumptions</i>
which I consider
as the dark side
provable security,
and will be a
subject of a later
post.
</p>
<p>
I hope
in the course of your studies,
this inchoate introduction
helps elucidate the gaps
as to the <i>why</i> of
provable security,
and the general concensus
on applicability.
If none of it makes sense now,
don't think too hard about it,
and
prove everything you can.

As an aside,
I find the text is a gentler introduction

by Jonathan Katz &amp Yehuda Lindell.
And it gets better!

I really have to give it to Mike,
he's doing a commendable job
breaking down the barriers of complexity
to newcomers of provable security and cryptography;
while remaining conscientious to students' pockets.

<p>
Caryl-Ann Margulies
in the math department of UCI
for teaching me cryptography
using Neal Koblitz graduate textbook
for insights, and dropping subtle hints
about his views.
What I found fascinating
is she didn't
seem to have the faintest
clue about
provable security.
But my theory is
she was feigning ignorance
so I would stay
Quan Nguyen &amp; Sky Faber
with their amazing intellect
in helping me
break down
security proofs.
(remember that time
I developed an attack
while I was asleep)?
Lastly,
Stanislaw Jarecki who taught
"applied cryptography" at UCI,
from K&amp;L. I took the
course twice with him.
The first time
was an undergraduate course
where all the students
had no idea what was going
on in the first week
and
could no longer follow on.
For all intents and purposes,
there were no grades
or any homework.
Regardless I was hungry
for any and all crypto
and
tried to keep up.
This experience
is 90% of the reason
why this post exists.
I want to make sure
any student taking
a provable security
course understands
what they're getting
into.
</p>
<p>
I almost forgot to
mention Alice Silverberg
for her graduate course
in mathematical cryptography.
I really enjoyed
the collaborative nature
of exchanging ideas
with other students
and presenting on interesting
topics of cryptography.
I didn't have the mathematical maturity
at the time
but felt lucky
to receive an advanced
education in
Elliptic Curve Cryptography
and
Lattice based Cryptography.
In case
you stumble across this,
I formally apologise
for not showing the proof
of security for
Clifford Cocks IBE scheme
when I presented on.
I honestly thought
computer scientists
were exempt from
such proofs :).
I need to get on it.
