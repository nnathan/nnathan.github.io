2019.11.06: An incomplete introduction to provable security
</h2>
<p>
This post is primarily aimed
to help uninitiated students
taking a cryptography course
and wondering what
this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security>provable security</a>
fuss is all about.
You probably chose
a course
titled
"Cryptography" or
"Modern Cryptography" or
"Applied Cryptography",
and thought it
had to do with
learning about actual cryptographic algorithms
and
implementing cryptography.
Sorry to say,
if you are here
figuring out what is going on
then you were probably bamboozled.
<!-- on the marketing of cryptography courses -->
Fear not,
I hope what you gte from this
is the virtues of
provable security
and
leave you a handy tip
to attack typical homework exercises.
If you put in the effort
I believe you will come out
of the course enlightened.
</p>
<p>
Provable security is a subfield of security
but mostly involves cryptography.
Cryptography lives in the intersection
of mathematics and computer science.
This distinction is important
and you will find cryptography
courses in math and computer science departments
is wildly different
and use a completely different language.
</p>
<p>
<i>Security reductions</i>
lie at the heart of
provable security.
A security reduction
is a "proof"
stating an algorithm (or protocol)
(virtually always linked to cryptography)
provides a specific security guarantee.
I like this excerpt from Joy of Cryptography
which
distills the essence
of security reductions:
<blockquote>
“<i>any</i> encryption scheme,
when combined with this other thing
in this specific way,
results in a system
with security property X,
as long as the encryption scheme
satisfies property Y”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The syntax of
a security reduction
is in the form of a logical implication:
<blockquote>
[Thing-Π is Y secure] &rArr; [Thing-Π is X secure]
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Thing-Π
is actually a <i>placeholder</i>
which can substituted
with a real
concrete implementation.
</p>
<p>
Let's look
at a concrete example:
<ul>
<li>
define Thing-Π
as <i>any</i>
encryption scheme
using randomised encryption
with
authentication
</li>
<li>replace (<i>instance</i>) Thing-Π with AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256</li>
<li>replace Y with IND-CCA2</li>
<li>replace X with IND-CPA</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
&rArr;
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CPA secure].
</p>
<p>
Note,
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is an <i>instance</i>
of Thing-Π.
We could have
used
something else
like
ChaCha20-Poly1305.
</p>
<p>
One could think
of
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
as an <i>advertisement</i>. <!-- add footnote: it is actually a security claim or security guarantee -->
The "product"
is the encryption scheme
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
which has all the
security features
of IND-CCA2 security.
Caveat emptor,
provable security
isn't a silver bullet
for security,
as with all matters in life,
it helps to maintain
a healthy level <a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>of skepticism.</a>
Provable security
claims are helpful
to cryptography practitioners
and
required by <a href=https://www.nist.gov/topics/cryptography>standard committees</a>
which vet and
publish security schemes.
</p>

<p>
Ok,
back to security reductions.
Ostensibly,
a security reduction
communicates
a set of related ideas:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the security of Thing-Π which is Y-secure is X-secure</li>
<li> the security of Thing-Π with Y-security <i>reduces</i> to X-security</li>
<li> Thing-Π with Y-security is <i>at least as secure</i> as X-security</li>
<li> an attack on X is an attack on Y</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example,
if someone says their encryption scheme
is IND-CCA2 secure
then you can say
it resists all attacks
to IND-CPA, a weaker security notion.
</p>
<p>
As a student
you will need to prove
security reductions,
that will make up
most of your coursework.
I'm going to finish
with a simple tip
for those who struggle
with attacking a proof.
</p>
<p>
In case you aren't aware or didn't realise,
most security reductions
is proven
using <i>proof by contradiction</i>.

When you encounter
<center>[Thing-Π is X-secure]
&rArr;
[Thing-Π is Y-secure]</center>.

First drop Thing-Π
and rewrite as
[X-security] &hArr; [Y-securty].
To simplify further
we reword to say
[<b>no</b> attack against X] &hArr; [<b>no</b> attack against Y].
(By the way,
we will bring back Thing-Π
in a cool minute.)

Now apply the following transforms:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Apply contrapositive rule
(<b>P</b> &rArr; <b>Q</b>)
&hArr;
(&not;<b>P</b> &rArr; &not;<b>Q</b>).
</br>[<b>an</b> attack against Y]
&rArr;
[<b>an</b> attack against X]</li>
</br>
<li>Apply material implication
(<b>P</b> &rArr; <b>Q</b>)
&hArr;
(<b>P</b>&or;&not;<b>Q</b>):
</br>
</br>[<b>an</b> attack against Y]
<b>or</b>
[<b>no</b> attack against X]</li>
<li>Negate statement using De-Morgan's law
&not;(<b>P</b> &or; <b>Q</b>)
&hArr;
(&not;<b>P</b> &and; &not;<b>Q</b>)
[<b>no</b> attack against Y]</li>
&and;
[<b>and</b> attack against X]</li>
</br>
</ol>

<p>
This probably sounds
wonderful or pointless theory.
At the
end of the day
you want to know
"is the thing secure?"
The provable security
framework
<i>helps</i> to answer
the question
by defining security
and
then prove it.
Some consider it
a gold standard.
Students who put
in the effort
will probably come out
feeling enlightened
and come to the same conclusion.
Others believe
that provable security is <a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>mental masturbation
with harmful side-effects</a>.
And the foremost experts
<a href=https://www.ams.org/notices/200711/tx071101454p.pdf>refuse</a> to allow critique
of their dogma.
Then there are the practitioners,
also called applied cryptographers.
Some
<a href=https://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html>
don't bother</a>
advertise using provable security jargon.
Personally I view provable security
as a decent benchmark that cryptographers
should adhere to,
but remains insufficient
as a measure
of security.
<!-- footnote to say the definitions for security and privacy is surprisingly hard and adversaries are moving targets -->
</p>


<p>
So far
I have given a
superficial view
to provable security.
I didn't even touch
on <i>assumptions</i>
which I consider
the dark side of
provable security,
and may be a subject
of a later post.
I hope
in the course of your studies,
this inchoate introduction can
will help fill in missing context.
If none of it makes sense now,
don't think too hard about it,
and
prove everything you can.

This is a quote from chapter 2 in
<a href=https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto/>The Joy of Cryptography</a> by Mike Rosulek.
As an aside,
I find the text is a gentler introduction
compared to the quintessential textbook
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Cryptography-Principles-Protocols/dp/1584885513>Introduction to Modern Cryptography</a>
by Jonathan Katz &amp Yehuda Lindell.
And it gets better!
The Joy of Cryptography costs nada (Creative Commons).

I really have to give it to Mike,
he's doing a commendable job
breaking down the barriers of complexity
to newcomers of provable security and cryptography;
while remaining conscientious to students' pockets.

Security reductions are
not exclusive to
encryption schemes

that has some security property.

Oh man.
try proving 3-round
