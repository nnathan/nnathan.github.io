<h2>
2019.11.06: A brief introduction to provable security
</h2>
<p>
This post is primarily aimed
to new students of cryptography
who struggle with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security>provable security</a>.
</p>
<p>
A security reduction is a proof
that demonstrates [1][2][3]:
<blockquote>
“<i>any</i> encryption scheme,
when combined with this other thing
in this specific way,
results in a system
with security property X,
as long as the encryption scheme
satisfies property Y”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The syntax of
these homework problems
is typically in the form:
<blockquote>
show [Thing-Π is Y secure] &rArr; [Thing-Π is X secure]
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Thing-Π
is actually a <i>placeholder</i>
which can substituted
with a real
concrete implementation.
</p>
<p>
Let's look
at a concrete example:
<ul>
<li>
define Thing-Π
as <i>any</i>
encryption scheme
using a block cipher
in counter mode
with Encrypt-then-MAC
</li>
<li>replace (<i>instance</i>) Thing-Π with AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256</li>
<li>replace Y with IND-CCA2</li>
<li>replace X with IND-CPA</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
&rArr;
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CPA secure].
</p>
<p>
Note,
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is an <i>instance</i>
of Thing-Π.
We could have
used
something else
like
CHACHA20-POLY1305.
</p>
<p>
One can think
of
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
as an <i>advertisement</i>.
The "product"
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
has all the
security features
of IND-CCA2 security.
Caveat emptor,
provable security
isn't a silver bullet
on security claims,
as with all matters in life,
it helps to maintain
a healthy level <a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>of skepticism.</a>
Of course,
this is all theoretical,
in practice
<a href=https://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html>nobody really advertises</a>
their product
relies on IND-CCA2 security.
</p>
<ul>
<li> the security of Thing-Π (which is Y-secure) is X-secure
<li> the security of Thing-Π with Y-security <i>reduces</i> to X-security
<li> Thing-Π Y-security is <i>at least as secure</i> as X-security
<li> a generic attack on security property X means an attack on any scheme satisfyin Y-security.
</ul>
For example,
if someone says
their encryption scheme
is IND-CCA2 secure
then you can assume
it resists all attacks
to IND-CPA (a weaker security notion).

This is a quote from chapter 2 in
<a href=https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto/>The Joy of Cryptography</a> by Mike Rosulek.
As an aside,
I find the text is a gentler introduction
compared to the quintessential textbook
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Cryptography-Principles-Protocols/dp/1584885513>Introduction to Modern Cryptography</a>
by Jonathan Katz &amp Yehuda Lindell.
And it gets better.

I really have to give it to Mike,
he's doing a commendable job
breaking down the barriers of complexity
to newcomers of provable security and cryptography,
while not participating in the vile textbook industry.

[2]:
Security reductions are
not exclusive to
encryption schemes
but anything you want to show
that has some security property.
</p>
<p>
[3]:
The word <i>reduction</i>
relates to
reductions in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)>computability theory</a>.
</p>

Oh man.
try proving 3-round
Luby-Rackoff
is not a strong PRP
(pseudorandom permutation).
This is the kind of shit
that will give you nightmares.
