<h2>
2019.11.06: A brief introduction to provable security
</h2>
<p>
This post is primarily aimed
to help uninitiated students
taking a cryptography course
and wondering what
this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_security>provable security</a>
stuff is all about.
Sorry to say,
you have probably
been bamboozled.
In any case,
I hope to explain
the virtues of
provable security
and
give newcomers
a simple tip
for their homework
problems.
</p>
<p>
Provable security is a subfield of security
but mostly involves cryptography.
Cryptography lives in the intersection
of mathematics and computer science.
This distinction is important.
</p>
<p>
<i>Security reductions</i>
lie at the heart of
provable security.
A security reduction
is a "proof"
stating an algorithm
(usually involving cryptographic)
makes a security claim.
I like this excerpt
from The Joy of Cryptography
to describe the essence
of security reductions:
<blockquote>
“<i>any</i> encryption scheme,
when combined with this other thing
in this specific way,
results in a system
with security property X,
as long as the encryption scheme
satisfies property Y”
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The syntax of
a security reduction
is in the form of a logical implication:
<blockquote>
[Thing-Π is Y secure] &rArr; [Thing-Π is X secure]
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Thing-Π
is actually a <i>placeholder</i>
which can substituted
with a real
concrete implementation.
</p>
<p>
Let's look
at a concrete example:
<ul>
<li>
define Thing-Π
as <i>any</i>
encryption scheme
using randomised encryption
with
authentication
</li>
<li>replace (<i>instance</i>) Thing-Π with AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256</li>
<li>replace Y with IND-CCA2</li>
<li>replace X with IND-CPA</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
&rArr;
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CPA secure].
</p>
<p>
Note,
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is an <i>instance</i>
of Thing-Π.
We could have
used
something else
like
ChaCha20-Poly1305.
</p>
<p>
One can think
of
[AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
is
IND-CCA2 secure]
as an <i>advertisement</i>. <!-- add footnote: it is actually a security claim or security guarantee -->
The "product"
is the encryption scheme
AES256-CTR-HMAC-SHA256
which has all the
security features
of IND-CCA2 security.
Caveat emptor,
provable security
isn't a silver bullet
for security,
as with all matters in life,
it helps to maintain
a healthy level <a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>of skepticism.</a>
Provable security
claims are helpful
to cryptography practitioners
and
required by <a href=https://www.nist.gov/topics/cryptography>standard committees</a>
which vet and
publish security schemes.
</p>

<p>
This probably sounds
wonderful or pointless theory.
At the
end of the day
you want to know
"is the thing secure?"
The provable security
framework
<i>helps</i> to answer
the question
by attempting to
define security
and
then prove it.
Some consider it
a gold standard.
Students who put
in the effort
will probably come out
feeling enlightened
and come to the same conclusion.
Others believe
that provable security is <a href=http://anotherlook.ca/>mental masturbation</a>.
Some practitioners
<a href=https://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html>
don't bother</a>
advertising using provable security jargon.
Personally I think provable security
sets a decent benchmark for applied cryptographers
but is incomplete in defining security,
and provies a limited guarantee.
<!-- footnote to say the definitions for security and privacy is surprisingly hard and adversaries are moving targets -->
</p>
<p>
Ok,
back to security reductions.
Ostensibly,
a security reduction
communicates
a set of related ideas:
<ul>
<li> the security of Thing-Π which is Y-secure is X-secure
<li> the security of Thing-Π with Y-security <i>reduces</i> to X-security
<li> Thing-Π with Y-security is <i>at least as secure</i> as X-security
<li> an attack on X is an attack on Y.
</ul>
For example,
if someone says their encryption scheme
is IND-CCA2 secure
then you can say
it resists all attacks
to IND-CPA, a weaker security property.
</p>
<p>
There is
so much more to say
about provable security.
I haven't even touched
on <i>assumptions</i>
which is what I consider
the dark side of provable security.
But I hope this is sufficient
to mull over in the meantime.
It is my hope,
during the course of your studies,
this inchoate introduction can
help fill in some missing context.
If none of this makes sense,
mull over it.
<p>
<p>
<!-- footnote about how my undergrad provable security course was a disappointment -->
So I studied provable security
and I wanted to provide a tip
which is stupidly simple
but I find helpful to the uninitiated.
</p>

<p>
Incase you weren't aware or didn't realise,
most security reductions
are proven
using <i>proof by contradiction</i>.

When you encounter
<center>[Thing-Π is X-secure]
&rArr;
[Thing-Π is Y-secure]</center>
do the following:

<ol>
<li>rewrite in contrapositive:
[Thing-Π is <b>not</b> Y-secure] &rArr; [Thing-Π is <b>not</b> X-secure]</li>
<li>convert to material implication:
[Thing-Π is Y-secure] <b>or</b> [Thing-Π is <b>not</b> X-secure]</li>
<li>apply De-Morgan's law to negate the statement:
[Thing-Π is Y-secure] <b>and</b> [Thing-Π is <b>not</b> X-secure]</li>
</ol>

This is a quote from chapter 2 in
<a href=https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto/>The Joy of Cryptography</a> by Mike Rosulek.
As an aside,
I find the text is a gentler introduction
compared to the quintessential textbook
<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Cryptography-Principles-Protocols/dp/1584885513>Introduction to Modern Cryptography</a>
by Jonathan Katz &amp Yehuda Lindell.
And it gets better.

I really have to give it to Mike,
he's doing a commendable job
breaking down the barriers of complexity
to newcomers of provable security and cryptography,
while not participating in the vile textbook industry.

Security reductions are
not exclusive to
encryption schemes
but anything you want to show
that has some security property.

The word <i>reduction</i>
relates to
reductions in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)>computability theory</a>.

Oh man.
try proving 3-round
Luby-Rackoff
is not a strong PRP
(pseudorandom permutation).
This is the kind of shit
that will give you nightmares.
